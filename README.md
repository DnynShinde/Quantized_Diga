# Quantized_Diga
## Quantized Semantic Segmentation for Real-Time Deployment
### Applied static INT8 quantization to a pre-trained semantic segmentation model to reduce inference latency and
memory usage for real-time deployment.
### Achieved 2.6Ã— faster inference and 48% lower GPU memory consumption with negligible impact on accuracy.
### Tech Stack: PyTorch, torch.quantization
